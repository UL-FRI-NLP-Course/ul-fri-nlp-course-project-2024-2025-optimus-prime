Title: A Video Is Worth Three Views: Trigeminal Transformers for Video-based Person Re-identification
Query: Can you tell me about methods that use three self-view transformers and a cross-view transformer.

Title: Deeply Coupled Convolution–Transformer With Spatial–Temporal Complementary Learning for Video-Based Person Re-Identification
Query: What is an effective framework that deeply couples CNNs and Transformers to learn complementary spatial–temporal features for video-based person re-identification, using mechanisms like complementary content attention, hierarchical temporal aggregation, gated attention, and self-distillation?

Title: Multidirection and Multiscale Pyramid in Transformer for Video-Based Pedestrian Retrieval
Query: What Transformer-based pyramid framework applies vertical, horizontal, and patch-based divisions to build multi-direction and multi-scale feature representations for video-based pedestrian retrieval?

Title: Pose-Aided Video-based Person Re-Identification via Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network
Query: How can a two-branch network using a temporal pose-graph and a recurrent GCN with node- and time-attention modules be designed for pose-aided video person re-identification?

Title: Spatial and Temporal Memory Networks (STMN) for Video-based Person Re-Identification
Query: What architecture leverages spatial and temporal memory networks—plus a memory spread loss—to refine and aggregate frame-level features for handling distractors in video person re-identification?

Title: Learning Modal-Invariant and Temporal-Memory for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification
Query: How can modal-invariant projection and temporal-memory extraction be jointly applied to video-based RGB-IR person re-identification, and how does performance scale with tracklet length?

Title: Cross-video Identity Correlating for Person Re-identification Pre-training
Query: What pre-training framework models cross-video identity invariance via progressive multi-level denoising and employs identity-guided self-distillation for person re-identification?

Title: Video Person Re-identification using Attribute-enhanced Features
Query: How can pedestrian attribute embeddings be fused with appearance and temporal features to enhance video-based person re-identification performance?

Title: Watching You: Global-guided Reciprocal Learning for Video-based Person Re-identification
Query: How does global-guided reciprocal learning disentangle high- and low-correlation features to improve person re-identification across video frames, and what role does temporal reciprocal learning play in enhancing fine-grained cues?


# Databse queries
Title: WildlifeReID-10k: Wildlife re-identification dataset with 10k individual animals
Query: Is there a publicly available large-scale benchmark for animal re-identification that spans multiple species and addresses data leakage between training and test sets using time-aware and similarity-aware splits?

Title:ENTIRe-ID: An Extensive and Diverse Dataset for Person Re-Identification
Query: What large-scale person re-identification dataset addresses domain variability and model generalization by including millions of images from multiple cameras in diverse real-world conditions?

Title: IUST_PersonReId: A New Domain in Person Re-Identification Datasets
Query: Is there a person re-identification dataset focusing on challenges in Islamic cultural contexts, emphasizing modest clothing and scenes from markets, campuses, and mosques, to address fairness and bias in ReID?


# A FEW EXAMPLES FROM CVF, TO SHOWCASE THE INCLUSION OF THE NEW DATABASE
Title: Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification via Progressive Graph Matching and Alternate Learning
Query: How does the progressive graph matching mechanism align visible and infrared modalities in an unsupervised manner, and how is alternate learning used to refine pseudo labels for cross-modality person re-identification?

Title: Person Re-Identification Without Identification via Event Anonymization
Query: How can person re-identification be achieved without relying on identity labels, using event-level anonymization to preserve privacy in training and inference?

Title: View-decoupled Transformer for Person Re-identification under Aerial-ground Camera Network
Query: How can a transformer framework decouple view-related and view-unrelated features to improve aerial-ground person re-identification performance across heterogeneous camera views?

Title: Pyramid Spatial-Temporal Aggregation for Video-Based Person Re-Identification
Query: How can pyramid spatial-temporal aggregation leverage short-term and long-term temporal features with spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve video-based person re-identification accuracy
