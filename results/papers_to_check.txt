Title: A Video Is Worth Three Views: Trigeminal Transformers for Video-based Person Re-identification
Query: Can you tell me about methods that use three self-view transformers and a cross-view transformer.

Title: Deeply Coupled Convolution–Transformer With Spatial–Temporal Complementary Learning for Video-Based Person Re-Identification
Query: What is an effective framework that deeply couples CNNs and Transformers to learn complementary spatial–temporal features for video-based person re-identification, using mechanisms like complementary content attention, hierarchical temporal aggregation, gated attention, and self-distillation?

Title: Multidirection and Multiscale Pyramid in Transformer for Video-Based Pedestrian Retrieval
Query: What Transformer-based pyramid framework applies vertical, horizontal, and patch-based divisions to build multi-direction and multi-scale feature representations for video-based pedestrian retrieval?

Title: Pose-Aided Video-based Person Re-Identification via Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network
Query: How can a two-branch network using a temporal pose-graph and a recurrent GCN with node- and time-attention modules be designed for pose-aided video person re-identification?

Title: Spatial and Temporal Memory Networks (STMN) for Video-based Person Re-Identification
Query: What architecture leverages spatial and temporal memory networks—plus a memory spread loss—to refine and aggregate frame-level features for handling distractors in video person re-identification?

Title: Learning Modal-Invariant and Temporal-Memory for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification
Query: How can modal-invariant projection and temporal-memory extraction be jointly applied to video-based RGB-IR person re-identification, and how does performance scale with tracklet length?

Title: Cross-video Identity Correlating for Person Re-identification Pre-training
Query: What pre-training framework models cross-video identity invariance via progressive multi-level denoising and employs identity-guided self-distillation for person re-identification?

Title: Video Person Re-identification using Attribute-enhanced Features
Query: How can pedestrian attribute embeddings be fused with appearance and temporal features to enhance video-based person re-identification performance?
